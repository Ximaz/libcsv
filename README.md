# CSV Parser
This repository was created in order to create a ``libcsv.a`` using the C language. Because I wanted to challenge myself doing a parser, and having to start somewhere, I decided to try to make one for CSV.

# Installation
```bash
curl -s -X GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ximaz/libcsv/main/install.bash | /bin/bash
```
